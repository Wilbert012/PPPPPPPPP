# PPPPPPPPP

Welcome to an improvement of my 'PPPPPPPPP' C++ Inheritance code!

## Running the C++ Program

To run the C++ program, you will need to use Fleet. If you don't have a Fleet account, you can sign up for a Fleet account and download Fleet visit [https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/).

Once you have a Fleet account and installed, follow these steps to run the program:

1. Launch the Fleet and log in to your Fleet account.
2. Download these C++ program files (PPPPPPPPP folder).
3. In the PPPPPPPPP project, open the PPPPPPPPP folder and open the .fleet subfolder, then select the `run.json` file and click on the "Run" button.
4. The program should now run in Fleet and display the output in the console.

That's it! If you encounter any issues or errors while running the program, consult the documentation or forums for Fleet or reach out to their support team for assistance.
